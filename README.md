# ECE387-Final-Individual-Project: A Collection of Classic LCD Games
## Introduction
This project is a collection of LCD games on Arduino that served as a kid toy. Remember what I played with as a child, I came up with this idea because I spent a lot of time playing those games on the old Nokia when I was a child. We didn't have smartphones back then, but it was really fun to play those games. That is my precious memory, and I still miss that time. <br/>The I2C 20x04 LCD module will be used as the display. The design will have a menu that allows users to select one of those classic games. They can also go back to the menu when they finish one game. All games would need a joystick or a few buttons to control.
Intial thought on what games will be included:
* Tetris (this needs a joystick and a button)
* Snake (Absolutely classic, this only needs a joystick)
* Space Invaders (this needs a joystick and a button to fire)
* Flappy Bird (this only needs a joystick)
* and more (probably a game that two players can play together)
## Prototype Setup

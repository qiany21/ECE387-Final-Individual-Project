# ECE387-Final-Individual-Project: A Collection of LCD Games
## Introduction
This project is to build a collection of LCD games on Arduino served as a kid toy. The design will have a menu that allows user select one of those classic games. They can also go back to menu when they finish one game. All games would need a joystick or a few buttons to control.
Intial thought on what games will be included:
* Snake (Absolutly classic, this only needs a joystick)
* Space Invaders (this needs a joystick and a button to fire)
* Flappy Bird (this only needs a joystick)
* and more to be designed in the future.

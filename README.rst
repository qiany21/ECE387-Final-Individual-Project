Introduction
------------

This project is a collection of LCD games on Arduino that served as a kid toy. Remember what I played with as a child, I came up with this idea because I spent a lot of time playing those games on the old Nokia when I was a child. We didn't have smartphones back then, but it was really fun to play those games. That is my precious memory, and I still miss that time. The I2C 20x04 LCD module will be used as the display. The design will have a menu that allows users to select one of those classic games. They can also go back to the menu when they finish one game. All games would need a joystick or a few buttons to control.
Intial thought on what games will be included (It depends on how much time I have):

- Snake (Absolutely classic, this only needs a joystick)
- Space Impact (this needs a joystick)
- Flappy Bird (this only needs a joystick)
- and more (probably a game that two players can play together)

In the end, I only have time for building two games. One is the Snake, another is the Space Impact. There is also an menu to choose the game the user want to play.
